What are all the plugins in jenkins you have worked on ?
How to run a job parallely 
	- we can run free style job parallely by using "Execute concurrent builds" in general section 
	
	Pipeline 
	- By default pipeline job runs concurrently.
	- To run stages parallely we need to define the stages inside parallel block.

Groovy 

Type of pipeline job in jenkins

scripted pipeline 
	- Traditional way of writing groovy script 
	- most of the options or configuration should be done manually.
	- Most of the time we use inline block to write scripted pipeline.
	- All the code is defined inside node block
		
		node { 
		
		}
		
declarative pipeline
	- New way of writing groovy declaratives 
	- most of the options are predefined in declarative pipeline 
	- we always write in a file called Jenkinsfile which is chechedin a SCM (git)
	- all the code is defined inside pipeline block 
	- The mandatory components of pipeline will be agent, stages, stage, steps
	
		pipeline {


		}	
		
		
How to define a pipeline job in jenkins
	1. We can add pipeline configuration in 2 ways 
		a. We write all the configuration inside the pipeline job in job ui only.
		b. We can write all the configuration in a file called Jenkinsfile and we can add that 
		   from a SCM/Version control 
	2. We are using only declarative pipeline type in our company.
	
Jenkinsfile	
	- It is the file in which we write all our job configuration in groovy.
	- In our company we are using declarative piepline in Jenkinsfile and we are maintaining 
	  Jenkinsfile through git.	

Agent
	- An agent is a declarative used to defince the execution method for piepline stages.
	- agent is the one which tell stages to execute on which node and its executro.
	- Agent can be specified at two levels 
				a. pipeline level 
				b. Stage level
		
	Types of agent 
		any 
			- This is the default agent, If I wont specify any agent this will be considered.
			- Runs the pipeline stages on any available node executor.
			
		none 
			-  To define executor for each and every stage declare agent as none at pipeline level.
			-  Using this we specify jenkins that agent is controlled at each stage level.
			-  Devining agent at stage level is mandatory. 
				
		label 
			- we can define agent as label at pipeline to run all the stages of pipeline
			  on a perticular node with label.
